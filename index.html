                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Princess Kemi, and the name of my brand is 'Princess Khay'. I am an undergraduate student of a federal university in Nigeria, and currently studying Glass & Silicate technology. I have decided not to rely only on the certificate i'll get from my undergraduate degree in order to be successful in life, but to also have great skills(especially in the tech field) that I can use to save myself in this world. I am a graphic designer, and also a frontend developer. I started my tech journey in April 2022 and I have gained a lot of knowledge and skills so far. I love taking on new challenges in order to test my potentials.</p>
